     <question>Why is the site descriptor not signed?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
         The <code>site.xml</code> that can be deployed alongside parent POMs was originally attached to the project in such a
         way that the GPG Plugin could not get hold of it. To enable signing of the site descriptor, you need to update to
         Maven Site Plugin 2.1.1+ which contains the required fix (see also
         <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSITE-478">MSITE-478</a>).

   <faq id="no-pinentry">
     <question>Why am I getting "gpg: signing failed: No pinentry" while releasing?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
         When plugin used in combination with <a href="https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/">Maven Release Plugin</a>
         the GPG signing will happen in "batch mode". This implies that you must either use GPG passphrase passed in
         via environment variable (preferred on systems like CI systems are), or, if on Workstation, using primed
         gpg-agent is needed. Read more here about <a href="usage.html#sign-artifacts-with-gnupg">GPG Agent priming</a>.
